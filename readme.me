# SDx-Host-FPGA-datapath-example
Datapath between host and FPGA(Alveo U200) via OpenCL and AXI channel. This is extracted from a larger project so there are some other files.

This example project implements the process of reading or writing data from host to FPGA via OpenCL and AXI channel.



There is also a memory latency and cycles of this reading/writing process.

Memory test for reading 16KB features in different granularties and orders:
